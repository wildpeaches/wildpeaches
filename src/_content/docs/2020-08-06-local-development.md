## Installing Git and NodeJS

To run your local instance you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/download/) and [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
installed. Pick your poisonâ€”I prefer to install them via the [brew](https://brew.sh/) package manager for MacOS, so thatâ€™s the documented approach.

This part is from memory, so ðŸ¤ž.

First git (installed by default on Mac, but older version)

```bash
brew update && brew install git
```

Next, the longterm support version (lts) of nodeJS via node version manager (nvm)

```bash
brew update && brew install nvm && nvm use --lts
```

To verify if nodeJS is running

```bash
node -v # should return version number
```

Make sure youâ€™ve been added to the repository as a contributor, next, itâ€™s time to clone.

## Cloning the Repository

Use your favorite client, or if you opt for the CLI, make sure youâ€™re in the parent directory and clone:

Either over SSH â€¦

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JanDW/wildpeaches.git
```

â€¦ or over HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanDW/wildpeaches.git
```

Change into the cloned repo directory and install the dependencies (they areâ€”as is common,â€”not in the repository, so this is a necessary step)

```bash
cd wildpeaches && npm install
```

If you see some warnings, donâ€™t be too alarmed, as long as you make it through ðŸ¤“

## Local Development

Among the dependencies is a web server, so youâ€™re all set to spin up the site locally.

```bash
npm run serve
```

Check whatâ€™s returned in the terminal, near the end of the output you should see something similar to

```bash

 ----------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:8080

Just open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and you should see the site.
