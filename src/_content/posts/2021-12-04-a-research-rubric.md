## The Perfect Bet

You want to learn something new. How do you do it? With easy access to the Internet, your first thought might be to let Google do the searching. Searching for terms about a subject often turns up more commonly used terms, and these new phrases may lead to areas you hadn't thought about initially. You can bookmark your searches, organize them into folders, and add [tags](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/categorizing-bookmarks-make-them-easy-to-find) to identify them using keywords in your bookmark manager.

Your search can be more organized than just collecting web page links into bookmarks. With the many new software tools available, you can search a topic efficiently, add tags and annotations to scientific papers, and automatically summarize the key concepts. To illustrate these ideas, I'm going to demonstrate the process by finding literature on predicting the outcomes of soccer matches.

The [goodreads summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195954-the-perfect-bet) of Adam Kucharski's _The Perfect Bet: How Science and Math Are Taking the Luck Out of Gambling_ says,

> For the past 500 years, gamblers - led by mathematicians and scientists - have been trying to figure out how to pull the rug out from under Lady Luck. In _The Perfect Bet_, mathematician and award-winning writer Adam Kucharski tells the astonishing story of how the experts have succeeded, revolutionizing mathematics and science in the process. The house can seem unbeatable. Kucharski shows us just why it isn't. Even better, he demonstrates how the search for the perfect bet has been crucial for the scientific pursuit of a better world.

The book shows how to beat casino games, bet on sports, and gives optimal stock trading techniques. We thought that soccer might be a fun way to begin learning about predicting the outcome and betting on the results. But as Jan pointed out, soccer games are typically low-scoring. Kucharski's solution is in-game betting. Which team will take the next shot at the goal? Which team will control the ball the longest over the next five minutes?

Kucharski quoted an article from [The Post Game](https://www.thepostgame.com/#who-we-are), [_Betting After The Games Are Underway_](http://www.thepostgame.com/blog/spread-sheet/201101/betting-after-games-are-underway) about Cantor Fitzgerald, an entrepreneur who started CG Technology to handle these bets. A 2016 [ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/17707481/las-vegas-sportsbook-cg-technology-was-fined-225m-illegal-gambling-money-laundering-scheme) says that CG Technology was fined $22.5M for illegal gambling and money laundering. It appears that William Hill Race & Sportsbook has [acquired parts of CG Technology](https://www.williamhill.us/william-hill-acquisition-of-select-assets-of-cg-technology-formerly-cantor-gaming-faqs/), but it's not clear if in-game betting on soccer is still available. So, maybe we won't be able to bet on games, but even if we can, we still need to figure out how to do it. We need the prediction part first.

## The Process

Aaron Tay's [Musings about librarianship](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/) is a marvelous blog about conducting online research. Aaron is a Library Analytics Manager at Singapore Management University and is the founder of [Initiative for Open Abstracts](https://i4oa.org/) to promote unrestricted access to scholarly research. One of his blog posts, [_Navigating the literature review_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/12/navigating-literature-review-metaphors.html?q=google+search) describes the process of literature review, and contains some useful online tools. At the end of this post, I'll provide a more complete set of tools, but since Aaron has already picked out the ones he thinks are likely to be the most useful, we'll go through his process.

Normally, I'd recommend finding an expert or two as a first step, but "soccer gambling" is such an esoteric concept it's unlikely that you'd find a real expert in both soccer and gambling. We'll resort to doing online searches for this project. Aaron also has a post, [_Top new tools for researchers worth looking at_](https://aarontay.medium.com/top-new-tools-for-researchers-worth-looking-at-9d7d494761b0) with many good searching methods.

Simply reading about a subject doesn't make you an expert, though. You have to experiment with and practice the new concept. "How do you get to [Carnegie Hall?](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Explore/Articles/2020/04/10/The-Joke)", "Practice, man, practice."

Briefly, an outline of the method is

1. Make a folder for storing research articles, and set up a reference manager tool.
2. Look for papers containing key words to get an idea about commonly used terms in the field.
3. Find papers providing an overview of the subject, with references to more detailed articles.
4. Map the literature space by linking papers by similar topics, or through citations.
5. Read and summarize papers you've found, taking notes of important topics or methods mentioned.

## Set up a Reference Manager

Before beginning the search, we need to be able to save journal articles. Create a PDF folder somewhere on your hard drive. You can add subfolders if it helps keep some sort of organization to the papers. Most good reference managers will be able to handle a jumble of papers thrown into a single folder.

Aaron recommends [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), but alternatives I like are [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/) and [Docear](https://docear.org/). The site [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) recommends [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager) as another good reference manager with [ features similar](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/research-learn/citing-your-work-academic-integrity/citations/zotero-vs-mendeley-comparison/) to Zotero. Of course, Qiqqa claims it's [much better](http://www.qiqqa.com/About/Compare#) than Zotero, and since I've been using Qiqqa for a while I'll explain how it works. Qiqqa recently became [open source,](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source) so the latest version is available on [Github](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases), a quick tutorial is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b01GdtlyOmE), and the [Qiqqa manual](http://www.qiqqa.com/Content/Client/The%20Qiqqa%20Manual.pdf) is also online.

After you have saved articles to your PDF folder, start Qiqqa, click on "Guest" and at the top left corner you should see "Add PDFs or References". Click the drop-down arrow and then "Add Folder". Navigate to your PDF folder and select it, allowing subfolders. Qiqqa will then read each of the PDFs in your PDF folder using OCR, automatically adding tags and creating bibliographies for each paper. It may take a few minutes depending on how many papers you've downloaded, but when Qiqqa is finished you can select papers by tag, author, publisher, year, or custom search criteria. Double-clicking on the paper brings it up in a new tab.

When downloading a new PDF, you'll often find that the file name is something like _PhysRevX.7.041052.pdf_ when the title of the paper is _Quantum-Assisted Learning of Hardware-Embedded Probabilistic Graphical Models_. You don't need to change the file name title to match the paper title because Qiqqa will read the title and store it using the more readable form.

## Top Level or Keyword Searching

We want to figure out how to gamble on soccer. Or should we be betting on football? The [University of Reading Library](https://libguides.reading.ac.uk/database-searching/techniques) recommends combining key terms and truncating search words and using wildcards, combining search terms, and using  phrase and proximity searching. Since we're not sure that in-game gambling is still possible, we might be better off looking for a method or strategy to predict the outcome using something like "soccer AND prediction". Synonyms for "prediction" found in a [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com) are "forecast", "guess", "indicator", "prognosis" and "indicator" so we could try combinations of those as well.

A Google search for "soccer prediction" returns lots of predictions other people are making about soon-to-be played games such as these from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/). FiveThirtyEight gives a detailed description of how they [produce their predictions](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-club-soccer-predictions-work/) which mostly rely on [ESPN's Soccer Power Index](https://www.espn.com/world-cup/story/_/id/4447078/ce/us/guide-espn-spi-ratings) (SPI). James Curley provided the data and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code used by FiveThirtyEight on [GitHub](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata).

Arthur Caldas wrote an article on Medium, [_Beating soccer odds using Machine Learning â€” Project Walkthrough_](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/beating-soccer-odds-using-machine-learning-project-walkthrough-a1c3445b285a) that shows how to scrape data from the web, clean the downloaded data, and generate good features to use in the prediction.

A search on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&as_sdt=0,34) shows additional terms like "machine learning", "neural network", "model", "bayesian", and "results". This search returns papers such as

- _[Incorporating domain knowledge in machine learning for soccer outcome prediction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-018-5747-8)_
- [_Neural underpinnings of superior action prediction abilities in soccer players_](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/10/3/342/1651945?login=true)
- [_Optimizing the Prediction Process: From Statistical Concepts to the Case Study of Soccer_](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104647)

Other search engines such as [Microsoft Academic](https://academic.microsoft.com/home), [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/), and [Science Open](https://www.scienceopen.com/) provide alternate searching methods. BASE returned these links to very relevant papers,

- [_The Open International Soccer Database for machine learning._](https://push-zb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/frontdoor.php?source_opus=53951)
- [_The 2017 Soccer Prediction Challenge_](https://osf.io/ftuva/)
- [_pi-football: A Bayesian network model for forecasting Association Football match outcomes_](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/10780)

We should also take advantage of the papers referenced in _The Perfect Bet_:

## Review Papers

Review or "meta" papers are written by experts on a particular subject, and describe the current state of science on that topic. Review papers typically describe the work by many scientists with references to papers they've written. Review papers can be found with [2Dsearch](https://www.2dsearch.com/), using methods discussed by Aaron Tay in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/a-academic-librarians-thoughts-on-open-access/4-ways-to-find-review-papers-systematic-reviews-meta-analysis-and-other-rich-sources-of-82898aebb6e7).

![2Dsearch](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/2Dsearch.png)

<p align = "center"><b>2DSEARCH</b></p>

When you go to the 2Dsearch website, you'll see a blank area on the left and a results window on the right. Enter terms anywhere in the search term window. I chose "soccer", "review", and "prediction". Right-click on any word to bring up a list of suggested terms, and choose the most relevant ones. You can group similar terms by dragging a box around them, so in the Forecasting box I have "prediction", "forecast", "estimation", and "projections".

In the upper right corner of each box you can set the Boolean operator to "AND" or "OR" (upper case). Group all the search terms into a single box, labeled here as "Meta-analysis of soccer games prediction", and choose the Boolean "AND".

In the results window, choose the search space such as Lens.org. Other possibilities are Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and others. Double click on any paper to bring it up in a new tab. The three lines with a red dot in the upper left corner opens the global menu. A very useful starting point is the "How to use" button which will present introductory videos.

Using the search terms shown as well as "NOT injury" led to several useful papers,

- [On Modelling Soccer Data](http://statpostgrade.ch/bilan/student/vol3n4.pdf)
- [Modeling outcomes of soccer matches](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-018-5741-1)
- [The ARCANE Project: How an Ecological Dynamics Framework Can Enhance Performance Assessment and Prediction in Football](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-016-0549-2)
- [Predicting Sports Results with Artificial Intelligence â€“ A Proposal Framework for Soccer Game](https://www.lens.org/lens/scholar/article/113-844-320-745-042/main)

Another useful search tool is [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/). After entering the search terms, use the drop-down menu under "Publication Type" and select "Review" and "Meta Analysis". This returned,

- [Forty years of score-based soccer match outcome prediction: an experimental review](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Forty-years-of-score-based-soccer-match-outcome-an-Hub%C3%A1cek-Sourek/8a221f3af88556293982d7017633b100c1654421)
- [Dolores: a model that predicts football match outcomes from all over the world](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10994-018-5703-7.pdf)
- [Score-based soccer match outcome modeling â€“ an experimental review](http://ida.felk.cvut.cz/zelezny/pubs/MathSport2019a.pdf)
- [A Review on Football Match Outcome Prediction using Bayesian Networks](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1020/1/012004/pdf)

## Citation Mapping

Aaron's post _[More research/literature mapping tools - Connected Papers and CoCites](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/06/more-researchliterature-mapping-tools_16.html)_ reviews several citation mapping tools, and I liked Connected Papers best because it's browser-based and very fast. Type the name of a paper in the search bar and Connected Papers will display the abstract. Click on the abstract to get a graph of related papers,

![connected-papers](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/connected-papers.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Connected Papers</b></p>

Hovering over one of the circles displays the title, authors, and abstract of that paper, and lets you open it in a new tab. The closer a circle is to the original paper, the more similar it is in content. Darker colors represent newer papers. This is a similarity graph, not a citation tree, but [Citation Gecko](https://www.citationgecko.com/) is a way to see how papers are linked through citations. When you start Citation Gecko, it asks for a seed paper

![citation-gecko-seed-papers.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/citation-gecko-seed-papers.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Citation Gecko Seeds</b></p>

and after entering [_Dolores: a model that predicts football match outcomes from all over the world_](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10994-018-5703-7.pdf) other recommended seed papers are listed in a new pop-up window. After selecting the most relevant papers, click "Add selected seed papers" at the bottom of the window, which opens a new view.

![citation-gecko-recommended-papers.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/citation-gecko-recommended-papers.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Citation Gecko Recommended Papers</b></p>

This lets you see links between your seed papers and others. You can add some of these as new seed papers, or you can follow the link to the paper. In many cases, you can download the paper by following the link.

Another useful search tool is the [Local Citation Network](https://timwoelfle.github.io/Local-Citation-Network/) that generates a list of citations based on a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) (Digital Object Identifier) or list of DOI's and provides a graphical representation of the linked papers. Tim WÃ¶lfle, the author of Local Citation Network explains the differences between it and Citation Gecko on the [Leiden Madtrics](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/local-citation-network-and-citation-gecko-making-literature-discovery-fun) site.

Ujjal Marjit wrote a nice blog post describing the tool, [_Free Visualization Tool to Support Literature Survey_](https://researcherssite.com/free-visualization-tool-to-support-literature-survey/).

## Summarizing and Annotating

Finding and downloading a lot of papers is pretty pointless by itself. _The readings will continue until morale improves_. You might have collected weeks worth of reading material, so we'll need a quick way to extract important points from each paper.

Unlike reading a novel, you shouldn't read a paper from start to finish. Read the abstract and key terms, then look for the important topics in each section. Look up any terms you don't understand, and summarize the main points. Elsevier has an [infographic](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/infographic-how-to-read-a-scientific-paper) outlining the process with links to papers that go into more depth.

[Scholarcy](https://www.scholarcy.com/) developed an AI paper summarizer extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scholarcy-research-paper/oekgknkmgmaehhpegfeioenikocgbcib?hl=en-GB) and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/scholarcy-research-pape/bcghmjggkikigjnehajdkhnhddfmkbbd) that reads the paper currently open in your browser and generates tag words of key concepts, writes a summary, and gives an overview of the paper's methods, results, discussion, conclusions, and future work sections.

The summary is in Markdown format that can be read into editors like [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Key concepts highlighted by Scholarcy have links to Wikipedia articles to quickly understand unfamiliar terms. Click on a reference in the Markdown summary and a link will open in Google Scholar, scite\_, or it will open the paper. Scholarcy mangles equations, but it does a pretty good job of giving you the gist of the article.

![scholarcy.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/scholarcy.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Scholarcy</b></p>

An alternate to Scholarcy is [paper-digest](https://www.paper-digest.com/) described by Ujjal Marjit in [_How to Generate an Automatic Summary of Research Paper_](https://researcherssite.com/how-to-generate-an-automatic-summary-of-research-paper/). The summary is sparser than Scholarcy's but may be useful for a quick understanding of the basic outline.

![paper-digest.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/paper-digest.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Paper Digest</b></p>

As mentioned earlier, [Qiqqa](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source) (open source) manages your documents, but also has many tools for searching and annotating your documents. After starting Qiqqa, the home screen opens. Click on the drop-down icon "Add PDFs or References" and select "Add Folder" to import your library into Qiqqa. Qiqqa uses OCR to read the documents. If you have added new documents since you first started Qiqqa, it reads those as well. When it has finished, you will have a "Guest" library, which looks something like this:

![qiqqa-guest.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/qiqqa-guest.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Qiqqa</b></p>

In the left column are common tags and the number of papers with those tags. You can filter by Qiqqa Autotags (tags Qiqqa assigned), author, publication, year, theme (groups of common tags), or publication type such as article, book, or proceedings.

A search box in the upper right corner lets you find articles containing specific words or phrases. Here, I've searched for "pi-rating" and Qiqqa found seven papers with that term, sorting them by relevancy. Click on the search score block (yellow to red with percentages to the left of the title) to see page numbers where the term occurs in the paper.

![qiqqa-search-score.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/qiqqa-search-score.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Qiqqa Search Score</b></p>

You can highlight a reference, right-click and search the web for the paper using the built-in Qiqqa browser.

![qiqqa-browser.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/qiqqa-browser.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Qiqqa Browser</b></p>

As you read the paper, you can highlight important sections,

![qiqqa-highlighting.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/qiqqa-highlighting.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Qiqqa Highlighting</b></p>

and add annotations and tags.

![qiqqa-annotation.png](/assets/img/2021-12-04-a-research-rubric/qiqqa-annotation.png)

<p align = "center"><b>Qiqqa Annotation and Tags</b></p>

Annotations become searchable so you don't need to remember where they are in the paper. Qiqqa has many more features described in the online [manual](http://www.qiqqa.com/Content/Client/The%20Qiqqa%20Manual.pdf).

Hopefully, you'll be able to use some of these tools to improve your research skills. They won't make you an [expert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), but at least you'll be better informed.
