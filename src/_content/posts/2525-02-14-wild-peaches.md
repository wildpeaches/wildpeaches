In the summer of 2020 we (Jan De Wilde and John Peach) lived next door to each other in Arlington, MA. We seemed to have a lot of common interests such as biking, CNC machines, and solving puzzles. One of the puzzles we talked about was the [sliding number puzzle](https://jandw.github.io/slide-number-puzzle/) that Jan put online.

We talked about the mathematics behind the puzzle. Later, we thought about the probability of two cars meeting in the intersection of [Blossom and Sunset](https://wildpeaches.xyz/blog/the-wreck-at-blossom-and-sunset/) roads (where we lived at the time), and got around to the idea of writing a blog post about the problem, which became the origin of Wild Peaches.

Wild Peaches is a place to experiment with ideas in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. We want everyone to explore and have fun with concepts and experiments beyond the textbook level, but not so deep that someone needs to be a research scientist to understand them. Ideas are ["mind-sized"](https://mindstorms.media.mit.edu/), that is, self-contained within a few paragraphs, and we're very interested in looking at things in new ways. 

There are many excellent online sources for learning about math and physics such as [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/), [Dr Peyam](https://www.youtube.com/c/drpeyam), and [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA). Wild Peaches is different because we want you to apply mathematics to solving STEM problems, and to play around with the ideas yourself.

Each experiment or exploration is self-contained so that it can be explained in a single blog post, or at most a handful of posts, and each is meant to be fully reproducible by anyone. All of the code and data are saved to our Github [repository](https://gist.github.com/XerxesZorgon), which is accessible to download. You should be able to run the code and recreate the experiment as described in the blog report. The software we use is free, and usually open-source.

By combining reports about each experiment with the code and any data, we hope to do for amateur scientists what organizations like the [Open Science Foundation (OSF)](https://osf.io/), the [Center for Open Science (COS)](https://www.cos.io/) or [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction) do for professional scientists. There are no particular focus areas for Wild Peaches, and any STEM related idea can be explored.

In the early days of personal computers, [David H. Ahl](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Ahl%2C%20David%20H%2E) founded *[Creative Computing](https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing)* magazine which encouraged students to learn programming techniques while solving interesting problems, such as [AEDI, MUTAB, NEDA and SOGAL](https://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=175), a puzzle to estimate the probable outcome of a war between rival planets. Computers, software, and display graphics have greatly improved since the time of *Creative Computing*, but we hope to maintain the spirit of David Ahl's creativity in problem solving.

The style of Wild Peaches is meant to be informative to anyone who takes the time to explore the concepts. We encourage questions and corrections from readers, since we don't have a formal review system for articles. [Stuart Ritchie](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/stuart-ritchie), a psychologist at King's College asked the question ["The big idea: should we get rid of the scientific paper? "](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/11/the-big-idea-should-we-get-rid-of-the-scientific-paper?utm_source=pocket-newtab) recently in The Guardian. We're attempting to be Ritchie's answer by being completely open and transparent, online, and easy to revise and [correct](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124). 

We have several ways to connect with readers and experimenters. The [Wild Peaches Forum](https://github.com/JanDW/wildpeaches/discussions/76) is where you can find resources for experiments and discuss ideas in depth. You may post completed experiments to our blog, [Wild Peaches](https://wildpeaches.xyz/), our informal science and math journal. We welcome your submissions to the blog and will be glad to help with the editorial process. Use the [Wild Peaches Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/253238143289738) to post new ideas or ask quick questions about STEM topics. Send an [email](hi@wildpeaches.xyz) if you have an experiment you'd like to publish. Wild Peaches is not a peer-reviewed journal, we just want to have fun with STEM concepts!

Have fun exploring with Wild Peaches!
