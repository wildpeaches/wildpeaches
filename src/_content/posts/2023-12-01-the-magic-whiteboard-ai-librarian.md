## About the Librarian

In the previous post *[The Magic Whiteboard - The Obsidian Wizard](https://wildpeaches.xyz/blog/the-magic-whiteboard-part-i/)* we showed you how to set up the whiteboard using the note-taking application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Now, we'll extend the project by creating the AI Librarian. Most of the AI Librarian will be constructed from links in [*The Academic Browser*](https://wildpeaches.xyz/blog/the-academic-browser/) with a few new additions. 

The idea for The Magic Whiteboard was partly inspired by [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/) "A collaborative writing and publishing tool for scientists & researchers" although I'd been thinking about something similar for a while. 

<img src="/assets/img/2023-12-01-the-magic-whiteboard-ai-librarian/curvenote.gif" alt="curvenote" style="zoom:125%;" />

<p align = "center"><b>Curvenote Video</b></p>

The goals of The Magic Whiteboard are to have a self-contained AI-assisted workspace to help through the entire process from the initial concept to the final published article. Curvenote provides a workspace for writing a document and can export to many standard formats, links to JupyterLab notebooks, and provides real-time collaboration. The Magic Whiteboard also has all of these features, but The Librarian puts AI-based literature search at your fingertips. 

Curvenote has a free option, but charges for journal templates, more than one private project, and extended online storage space. The Magic Whiteboard is built from free components and the only fees are for the more capable AI chat models.

All of your documents and files are stored locally, unlike the online service Curvenote, but this means that you'll have to install Obsidian, plugins, and any other software you want to use. The advantage is that you have full control over your content.

## The Librarian's Links

Literature searching is evolving very rapidly, especially with the inclusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the ability to query in natural language. One of the best resources is Aaron Tay's [Musings about Librarianship](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/), and his articles [Using Large Language Models to generate and extract direct answers](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2023/07/using-large-language-models-to-generate.html) and [List of academic search engines that use Large Language Models for generative answers](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2023/09/list-of-academic-search-engines-that.html). 

These are some of my favorites, but you might prefer others.

### AI Chat

Ask questions and receive answers in natural language. Most of these require registration, but there is a free tier. Anthropic will let you upload a document for analysis, and all of them can be used in the writing process. We used Google Bard to write an outline in [Part I](https://wildpeaches.xyz/blog/the-magic-whiteboard-part-i/) of this series. The Obsidian plugin [Surfing](https://github.com/PKM-er/Obsidian-Surfing) will open any of them in a new tab. You may also want [Copilot](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot) and/or [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections) if you'd prefer to remain on the page.

### Online LaTeX Editor

Many journals require submissions to be in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format. You can install [TeXStudio](https://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) or [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) locally along with LaTeX compilers such as [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/). Another option is to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) which is a collaborative writing and publishing tool and LaTeX editor. 

Overleaf has templates for most journals making the writing process much easier. They charge $199 for online collaboration of up to 10 authors, but you can work alone for free. An open-source alternative is [SwiftLaTex](https://www.swiftlatex.com/).

### Collaboration

[Bit.ai](https://bit.ai/) Built for teams and individuals to create, collaborate, and organize all your knowledge in one place from anywhere in the world. Create fast dynamic notes, documents, wikis, knowledge bases, projects, client deliverables, technical docs, training guides, and client portals, while integrating across the apps you work with. The free plan has enough [features](https://bit.ai/pricing#Pricing-Features) that you should be able to collaborate with your colleagues. 

### Reference Manager

[Zotero](obsidian://shell-commands/?vault=The%20Magic%20Whiteboard&execute=wr0tipx9mg) is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research. Several plugins help integrate Zotero with Obsidian. Alexandra Phelan explains in ["An Updated Academic Workflow: Zotero & Obsidian"](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd) the steps she uses to connect the two apps. You should install [betterbibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) for Zotero (Tools $\rightarrow$ Add-ons). She recommends [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) but it is no longer [needed](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/zotero/zotfile) in version 6.0 and later for Zotero. 

Plugins for Obsidian are [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration), [Obsidian-Pandoc](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc), and the [Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list). [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) converts documents from one format into another, so you can write in Markdown in Obsidian and then convert to LaTeX, HTML, or MS Word to publish. You might also want to include a link to [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) (CSL) for [ZoteroBib](https://zbib.org/) to format references in a style compatible with your chosen publication.

Phelan also recommends the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Admonitions](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions) plugins for Obsidian. Dataview allows you to query your Obsidian vault and to search and display data as well as create summaries of referenced literature. Admonitions " is a tool that allows you to create attention-grabbing callouts, tips, warnings and other informative blocks within your notes". 

Under "Community Plugins" in the Settings window of Obsidian, click on "Zotero Integration". At the top, just under "General Settings", install the PDF Utility, and then under "Citation Formats" choose "Template" from the "Output Format" drop-down list. 

Copy and paste the template from the article under section *III. Literature Notes*. Under "Bibliography Style" you can select a publisher style by typing in the box. For example, if you type *iee* the list will expand to show *IEEE*, *IEEE (with URL)*, and *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging* as the first three choices.

In ["An Academic Workflow: Zotero & Obsidian"](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-56bf918d51ab) Phelan describes how she uses different highlighting colors to annotate a PDF:

![annotation-colors](/assets/img/2023-12-01-the-magic-whiteboard-ai-librarian/annotation-colors.webp)

<p align = "center"><b>Annotation Color Scheme</b></p>

Ideally, the reference system would be fully bidirectional. That is, you should be able to insert a reference into your document and just as easily insert a new reference into Zotero. With the Zotero Integration plugin, creating a reference in the document is very easy, and going the other way is almost as simple. 

Choose one of the methods provided by The Librarian and begin your literature search. I selected Perplexity to ask about optimally fitting Bezier polynomials to curve points. Perplexity provided a complete answer as well as a few relevant papers. One of the papers is in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and after copying and pasting the [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) (Document Object Identifier) into Zotero, Zotero finds the bibliographic information online and imports it into the current folder.

## The Zotero-Obsidian Link 

To be able to link Zotero and Obsidian, add the [Shell Commands](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands) plugin to Obsidian. From the [plugin documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/shellcommands/Basic+usage/How+to+define+shell+commands), make a new command by clicking on "Shell Commands" in the left column. This opens a new window,

![shell-commands](/assets/img/2023-12-01-the-magic-whiteboard-ai-librarian/shell-commands.webp)  

<p align = "center"><b>The Shell Commands Plugin</b></p>

where you can insert a link to the shortcut that starts Zotero. 

Test the link by clicking. It will take a few seconds for Zotero to start, but your library of references should appear. To add a new entry, see [Adding Items to Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero) and scroll down to "Add Item by Identifier". By clicking on the wand in the top bar, you will be able to enter the reference ID, and Zotero will automatically find the reference and fill in the details.

## The Librarian Layout

The Librarian relies on external websites that open in new tabs in Obsidian. To help keep your links organized, you might want to install the [Multi-Column Markdown](https://github.com/ckRobinson/multi-column-markdown) plugin. To create a multiple-column region, begin by typing three backticks, followed by *start-multi-column*. Enter a unique ID such as *The_Librarian* and enter the number of columns.

![start-multi-column](/assets/img/2023-12-01-the-magic-whiteboard-ai-librarian/start-multi-column.webp)

Enter the first column of links just below the second row of backticks. Headers are generated with hash marks (#) and bullet points with `Ctrl-]`. Put the source name in square brackets and the URL in parentheses immediately after to make hyperlinks `[Google](https://www.google.com/)`. You can also highlight the name and then type `Ctrl-k` to automatically insert the brackets.

The link for Zotero is made using the Shell Commands plugin described above.

At the end of the first two columns insert $\text{--- end-column ---}$ and after the end of the third column $\text{--- end-multi-column}$. Click out of the multi-column region to see the results:

![librarian-layout](/assets/img/2023-12-01-the-magic-whiteboard-ai-librarian/librarian-layout.webp)

<p align = "center"><b>The Librarian Tab</b></p>

The last component we need for The Magic Whiteboard is The Hacker which will use AI to help you write code for your STEM projects.
