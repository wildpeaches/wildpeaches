Inkscape is a Free and open source [vector graphics editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_vector_graphics_editors) for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It offers a rich set of features and  is widely used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as  cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It  uses [vector graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized [SVG file format](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including web browsers.
