Numerical simulation in industry requires the use of high performance methods in fluid mechanics, structural mechanics, electromagnetism, and others. The SALOME platform provides engineers/researchers/practitioners with a solution that allows them to benefit from high-level modules targeting: CAD, meshing, coupling of phenomena, visualisation, calculation supervision, uncertainties, etc, thereby aiding the overall pipeline of a numerical simulation. These modules can be directly used by easy-to-use GUI of SALOME or via Python scripts.
