A user-friendly, extendable application and API for drone image  processing. It provides a web interface to OpenDroneMap (ODM) with visualization,  storage and data analysis functionality. ODM turns simple point-and-shoot camera images into two and three  dimensional geographic data that can be used in combination with other  geographic datasets. In a nutshell, itâ€™s a program that takes images as input and produces a  variety of georeferenced assets as output, such as maps and 3D models.
