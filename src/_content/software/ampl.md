A fully integrated system of optimization, AMPL has been developed for the real-world modeler who needs to manage all phases of the optimization development cycle without sacrificing  computational performance. AMPLs straightforward language lets you formulate optimization models the way you think about them, and makes  model logic accessible to your team members.
