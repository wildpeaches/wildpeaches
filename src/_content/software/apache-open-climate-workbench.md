 Apache Open Climate Workbench is an effort to develop software that performs climate model evaluation using model outputs from a variety of different sources the [Earth System Grid Federation](http://esgf.llnl.gov/), the [Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment](http://www.cordex.org/), the [U.S. National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/) and the [North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program](http://www.narccap.ucar.edu/) and temporal/spatial scales with remote sensing data from [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/), [NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov/) and other agencies. The toolkit includes capabilities for rebinning, metrics computation and visualization.
