Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision framework.  To fully utilize Meshroom, a NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended. The binaries are built with CUDA-11  and are compatible with compute capability >= 3.5. Without a  supported NVIDIA GPU, only "Draft Meshing" can be used for 3D  reconstruction.
