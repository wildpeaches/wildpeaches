VisualSFM is a GUI application for 3D reconstruction using structure from motion (SFM). The reconstruction system integrates several of [Changchang Wu's](http://ccwu.me)  previous projects: [SIFT on GPU(SiftGPU)](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~ccwu/siftgpu/),  [Multicore Bundle Adjustment](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/mcba/), and [Towards  Linear-time Incremental Structure from Motion](http://ccwu.me/vsfm/vsfm.pdf). VisualSFM runs fast by  exploiting multicore parallelism for feature detection, feature matching, and bundle adjustment.
