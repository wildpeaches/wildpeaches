[Kubric](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) is an open-source Python framework that interfaces with PyBullet  and Blender to generate photo-realistic scenes, with rich annotations,  and seamlessly scales to large jobs distributed over thousands of  machines, and generating TBs of data. Kubric can generate semi-realistic synthetic multi-object videos with rich annotations such as instance  segmentation masks, depth maps, and optical flow.
