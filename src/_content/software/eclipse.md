Eclipse is an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) used in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming). It contains a base [workspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workspace) and an extensible [plug-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) development, and, until 2016, was the most popular.
