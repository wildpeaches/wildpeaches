Symbolic Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics. This library is a generalization of [SINDy](https://github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy), to be used for the reconstruction of dynamical systems with strong nonlinearities, which require the introduction of a combinatorial search in the elementary functions associated with the linear regression part of SINDy.
