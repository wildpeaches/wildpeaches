Vensim is a simulation software developed by Ventana Systems. It primarily supports [continuous simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_simulation) ([system dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Dynamics)), with some [discrete event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation) and [agent-based modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) capabilities. Vensim provides a graphical modeling interface with [stock and flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow) and [causal loop diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram), on top of a text-based system of equations in a declarative programming language.
