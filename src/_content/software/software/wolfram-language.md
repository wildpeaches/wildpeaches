[Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) - Wolfram Language is a symbolic language, deliberately designed with the breadth and unity needed to develop powerful programs quickly. By integrating high-level forms—like [Image](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Image), [GeoPolygon](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GeoPolygon.html) or [Molecule](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Molecule.html)—along with advanced superfunctions—such as [ImageIdentify](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageIdentify.html) or [ApplyReaction](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ApplyReaction.html)—Wolfram Language makes it possible to quickly express complex ideas in computational form.
