[Minsky](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minsky/) - Minsky brings system dynamics and monetary modelling to economics. Models are defined using flowcharts on a drawing canvas (as are Matlab's Simulink, Vensim, Stella, etc). Minsky's unique feature is the "Godley Table", which uses double entry bookkeeping to generate stock-flow consistent models of financial flows.
